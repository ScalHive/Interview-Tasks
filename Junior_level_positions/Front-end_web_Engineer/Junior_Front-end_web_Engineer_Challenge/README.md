All questions and discussion in issues of this project.


## Introduction

1. Solutions should be written in English language.
2. Use your personal GitHub account to fork current project and push
your solution to it (current branch and subdirectory).
3. Create pull request from your fork project with solution to base
repository.
4. All solutions should be in the same forked project with good code
style, comments and SOLUTION.md description.



## The priorities for solutions are:
  1) being correct
  2) being readable and extensible



### Challenge description

#### Project brief
Your goal is to pivot Github data in a way that users are in the
center of it. To narrow our scope lets focus for the purpose of this
exercise on [ScalHive repository](https://github.com/scalhive). You
can find there many repositories and each of them has its own
contributors. Recommended frameworks Angular2+ or React.

#### Your goal is
to create an app that will list ScalHive repositories
and some other details The app will contain three __distinct__ views:
- List of ScalHive repositories
- The repository details page where we can find list of contributors.
The list should be sorted by amount of contributions
- The contributor details page Judging criteria (top the most important)

#### Final working sample
- creating a usable product (UX)
- code quality
- fluentness, responsiveness & performance
- use git best practices for commits, branches etc.
The sample project should be stored on your personal repository and
link is send to team@scalhive.com.
